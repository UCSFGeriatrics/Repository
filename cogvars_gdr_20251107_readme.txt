This program derives the Composite memory score and Dementia probabilities variables following Wu et al., 2013 methodology from 1995/1996-2020

HRS Cognition Imputations 1992-2020 (data: COGIMP9220A_R) data were used instead of RAND HRS to get variables for direct assessments since
the cognition variables in RAND HRS are taken directly from the HRS imputations of cognitive functioning.

Note that the HRS introduced Internet interviews for the first time in 2018, and there is evidence that cognitive assessment in Internet interviews differs (most cognitive questions are easier when presented on a screen). The measures computed in this program for 2018 forward do not account for this.

Additionally, the 2020 measures do not account for the impact of COVID-19 on cognition.
