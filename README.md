# Additional Resources
### Geriatric Research Algorithms & Statistical Programs (GRASP) - hosted by OAIC National Coordinating Center Site
https://www.peppercenter.org/public/grasp.cfm

GRASP, a curated list of statistical analysis programs useful to biostatisticians engaged in studies of human aging, is an Internet resource development project of the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Centers at Yale University, Duke University and Wake Forest University. Development of the content was originally supported by National Institute on Aging grant 2P30 AG021342-06S1 to Yale University and is currently supported by National Institute on Aging grant numbers U24AG05964 for the OAIC CCC and R33 AG045050 for the Aging Initiative. GRASP topics can include downloadable code, sample data, links to online resources and any number of associated documents.
